## Email Caterorization - Spam Detection

Spam classification using NLP is a technique that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify emails or messages as spam or not spam. The technique involves analyzing the text of the message and extracting features that can help identify whether the message is spam or not. These features can include the presence of certain words or phrases, the length of the message, the use of capital letters, and other characteristics. The extracted features are then used to train a machine learning model that can classify new messages as spam or not spam. This technique is widely used in email filtering systems and messaging applications to prevent unwanted messages from reaching the user's inbox.
